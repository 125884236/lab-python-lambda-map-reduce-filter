  This exercise allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

  Upon completion of this exercise, you will be able to:
  
- Practice writing efficient and concise code using lambda functions.
- Learn how to use map, reduce, and filter to manipulate and transform data in Python.
- Practice combining lambda functions with map(), filter(), and reduce() to solve practical problems
- Acquire familiarity with lambda functions to establish a foundation of understanding for working with Python's apply and applymap method in the future.

## Introduction

Welcome to the lab on lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter in Python! In this lab, we will learn how to use lambda functions to create anonymous functions and apply them with built-in functions like map, reduce, and filter. These tools are very useful when manipulating data, and can be used to save time and create more efficient code.

Throughout the lab, we will practice creating lambda functions and applying them with map, reduce, and filter to solve various problems. By the end of the lab, you should feel comfortable using these tools and understanding their use cases. Let's get started!

## FAQs
<details>
  <summary>I am stuck in the exercise and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start.</summary>
  <br>

  If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear question about the specific issue you are facing. This will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.


  For example, is it a concept that you don't understand, or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources. 


  Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you will be able to start working toward the solution.

  <summary>I am unable to push changes to the repository. What should I do?</summary>
  <br>

There are a couple of possible reasons why you may be unable to *push* changes to a Git repository:

1. **You have not committed your changes:** Before you can push your changes to the repository, you need to commit them using the `git commit` command. Make sure you have committed your changes and try pushing again. To do this, run the following terminal commands from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push
  ```
2. **You do not have permission to push to the repository:** If you have cloned the repository directly from the main Ironhack repository without making a *Fork* first, you do not have write access to the repository.
To check which remote repository you have cloned, run the following terminal command from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
If the link shown is the same as the main Ironhack repository, you will need to fork the repository to your GitHub account first and then clone your fork to your local machine to be able to push the changes.

**Note**: You should make a copy of your local code to avoid losing it in the process.
